## Run instructions

Please get into the root path and then run the commond `ruby test.rb`.


## Note

If you add new words to words.txt, please delete the files in the /word_data directory.

If network cannot get through, I let the guess process try again. But it will waste one valuable time.

Please make sure the words list is enough. If the program have tried all the words in the words.txt and not found any matched word, the program will indicate that you need to add new word to the word list.
